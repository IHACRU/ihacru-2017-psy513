## Load Data
<!-- Load the datasets.   -->

```r
ds_patient_events <- readRDS(path_input_patient_events) # %>% as.data.frame()
ds_location_map   <- readRDS(path_input_location_map)

ds_patient_events  %>% glimpse()
ds_location_map %>% glimpse()
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->


## Data Tweaks
<!-- Tweak the datasets.   -->

```r
# augment the event table with additional columns from location map
ds <- dplyr::left_join(
  ds_patient_events,             # patient event table
  ds_location_map %>%         # location map 
    dplyr::select_(.dots = components_location_map)
  ,by = c("location_map_id","palette_code","palette_colour_name") 
) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    location_class_description_display    = substr(location_class_description,1,42)
    ,palette_colour_name_display = substr(palette_colour_name,1,42)
  )
ds_location_map %>% glimpse()
# from this point on, ds_location_map is needed only for selective reference
ds %>% glimpse()
# ds now contains full coordinates to events of the cohort down to unit level
# ehr_address + location_classifiers + palette_colours
```

# II. Patient Events
The main data set `ds` contains both patient events table and their location map coordinates.

```r
# the data object containing events and location map 
ds %>% glimpse()
```
